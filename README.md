### About the Site

Leo Club of Colombo Hogwarts is a youth charity organization established in Sri Lanka and is operated under Lions Clubs International. Since their club theme is inspired by the J. K. Rowling's Wizarding world, I tried to give the site a little bit of Wizadry vibe while maintaining the clean aesthetics. **Also, this website made to be fully responsive to all desktop and mobile screen sizes.**

### Technologies used

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5.2.1 framework (only for few sections)
- CSS3
- Javascript

Background image is from the Hogwarts Legacy video game.

### Third party libraries and services used

- Google fonts for Lato and Crismson font
- CDN fonts for other fonts
- Font awsome library for icons
- FlipHTML5 for the newsletter hosting and popup
- Slick carousel for the project card image carousels
- Jquery for Slick carousel initialization and adjustments
- Vercel for production deployment and hosting
- Squarespace for domain name services

!NOTE: First, the project was built upon Bootstrap 5, but when keep adding features and optimizations, it was really hard for me to get the look and feel I want with just BS5 framework, since I'm not familiar with SCSS yet, I decided to use native CSS and JS to handle the most sections of the page. CSS may be a little bit messy for the time bieng, but I will keep making new ammendments when I make progress in the project.

Feel free to fork and star the repo.
