### About the Site

Leo Club of Colombo Hogwarts is a youth charity organization established in Sri Lanka and is operated under Lions Clubs International. Since their club theme is inspired by the J. K. Rowling's Wizarding world, I tried to give the site a little bit of Wizadry vibe while maintaining the clean aesthetics. 

**Also, this website made to be fully responsive to all desktop and mobile screen sizes.**
