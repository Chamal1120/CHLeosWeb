### About the Site

Leo Club of Colombo Hogwarts is a youth charity organization established in Sri Lanka and is operated under Lions Clubs International. Since their club theme is inspired by the J. K. Rowling's Wizarding world, I tried to give the site a little bit of Wizadry vibe while maintaining the clean aesthetics. **Also, this website made to be fully responsive to all desktop and mobile screen sizes.**

### Technologies used

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5.2.1 framework (only for few sections)
- CSS3
- Javascript

Background image is from the Hogwarts Legacy video game.

! NOTE: First, the project was built upon Bootstrap 5, but when keep adding features and optimizations, it was really hard for me to get the look and feel I want with just BS5 framework, since I'm not familiar with SCSS yet, I decided to use native CSS and JS to handle the most sections of the page. CSS may be a little bit messy for the time bieng, but I will keep making new ammendments when I make progress in the project.

Feel free to fork the repo and remake your own sites using my code as an template, but don't forget to star the repo, follow me and give me a lil credit.
